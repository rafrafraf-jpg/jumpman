# jumpman
a small pygame game called jumpman. it is a 2d side scrolling platformer.

if you would like to add levels to the game, you must add a list like the following: "['i','o','c','g','r','b']" into the array called blockgridtmp inside settings.py.

note that the level you create must be the same height and width as the 5 i have made.

moreover 'i' will create an invisible block, 'o' will leave the space empty, 'c' will create a castle brick block at its pos, g is grass, r is redgrass and b is brick.
